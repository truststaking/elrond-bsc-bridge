@title ERC20 Safe for bridging tokens
@author Elrond & AgileFreaks
@notice Contract to be used by the users to make deposits that will be bridged
@notice The deployer is also the admin of the contract.
In order to use it:
- The Bridge.sol must be deployed and must be whitelisted for the Safe contract.
@dev The deposits are requested by the Bridge, and in order to save gas spent by the relayers
they will be batched either by time (batchTimeLimit) or size (batchSize).
There can only be one pending Batch.
